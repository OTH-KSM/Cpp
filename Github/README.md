Hello This is The first commit 
Questions :
1: Why header files of cpp doesn't ends with .hpp
like /#include <iostream>
and not /#include <iostream.hpp>


Problems :
1- entring tabulation in names (first name) not counted 4 spaces but just 2 character (when using getline)

2- when entring a character in the prompt for searching index and error accure when failing stoi to convert a character to integer
EX : -------3, 'O'...
Error : libc++abi.dylib: terminating with uncaught exception of type std::invalid_argument: stoi: no conversion

# Introduction To OOP:

The C++ cames with a very dynamic consept which is The Object Orionted Programming is a smallest definition
is the consept of creation of objects; instance of classes that act like a bleuprints defining the structure
and behavior of these objects. OOP emphasizes consepts like encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism and 
abstraction.

To descover what's really is this OOP we should first know that is an Object and to do that lets know now that is a primitive date types.

## Primitive Data Types :

A primitive Data Types serve to store A single simple value like : byte, Int, Char, Float ...
Those data types were more that enough for simple programs at the beginning of the programation
but with the developement and the programs being more complicated those Primitive data types where not suffisant for those new programs.

we need to group data for an effitiant use i can't use just character i need to use a string and not just strings i need to use multiple strings as a group and this what we called an array which is a group a multiple values of the same data types like : <br>

An Array of Characters :
```
char ArrayOfChar[] = {"Othmane", "Amine", "Bannana"};
```

An Array of Integers:

```
int ArrayOfInt[] = {123, 5, 33};
```

> we solve the problem know we can use a multiple values as group Is that enough ?? <br>
> What if i need to group Ineger 5 and A string "Mouse" and use it as a data type 

We can't do that now because and as i said before An Array is collection of values of the same Data types so We can't 

> And What we should do know ?

In C comes the consept of Structure to helps us to use multiple data types in one single collection like this :
```
Struct Cluster {
        char Name[];
        char Mode[];
        int NumberOfPosts;
        bool state;
        int position;
}
```
> but I need to add to add some funtions to that struct can we do that In c ?

No we can't do that becuase that C doesn't support tha OOP that we are talking about and that's what C++ cames for to sole and to intoduce The new Data types Class
Class helps us to assemble :

- multiple values 
- with different data types
- and group them with functions

and from that class we can create an instance of that class that act like a family and from that family we have objects that represent members of this family each one of them has its caracteristics and cames from this family.

And This is The answer of what is an Object
